# Myocardial Infarction Complications Prediction

This project aims to predict complications following a myocardial infarction (heart attack) using machine learning, guided by the CRISP-DM methodology.

## Project Overview
Myocardial infarction, or heart attack, can lead to serious complications in recovery. Using data and machine learning, this project seeks to identify and predict these complications to support better patient outcomes.

## Project Stages
Following the CRISP-DM method, the project has reached the **Data Preparation** stage, covering the following steps:

1. **Business Understanding**: Define the problem and project objectives.
2. **Data Understanding**: Analyze and assess the dataset's features and structure.
3. **Data Preparation**: Process and clean data for analysis (current stage).
